# dryice: Don't Repeat Yourself - Instead Code Efficiently

## What is dryice?

[***dryice***](https://www.dryice.dev) is a collection of data structures implemented in JavaScript that can be used for learning and competitive programming.

## Why dryice?

Ever tried to use JS for solving problems on coding platforms? Were you also told that you should be using C/C++/Java for learning DSA? And somehow, you also ended up believing them, because why not? You tried to use JavaScript on coding platforms, only to realize they don't provide any external library for their JS engines (unlike they do for C++/Java). You spent hours looking for a Linked List implemented in JavaScript, hardly finding anything useful. A good amount of time is wasted looking for resources on the Internet than solving the question itself. And then, one day you decide to use some other language for DSA, even if you weren't very comfortable with it. But guess what? You ain't alone. :D

*Don't Repeat Yourself - Instead Code Efficiently*, abbreviated as [***dryice***](https://www.dryice.dev), is all that a JavaScript developer would ever need to learn DSA and solve problems on coding platforms without learning any other language. dryice is a collection of data structures implemented in JavaScript that you can use for learning DSA without leaving the comfort of your favorite language. You don't have to spend hours looking for a native JavaScript implementation for a Linked List only to solve a problem that would otherwise take less than 10 mins.
And also, don't forget to install the [dryice Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dryice/nnmdkginmhadcfifcaflfkidllcemhmb?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon) for Leetcode! That for sure is going to save you a lot of time.
